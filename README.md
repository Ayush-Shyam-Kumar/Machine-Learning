Machine Learning Algorithms and Theory  
This repository contains implementations of basic machine learning algorithms in multiple programming languages. Including the algorithms implemented from scratch and using pre-defined libraries in the corresponding programming language used. This repository intents to provide a simple insight over the concept and basic coding approach towards it.
